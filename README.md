# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the SQL Data Warehouse Project! This repository demonstrates the construction of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, featuring a multi-layer architecture with bronze, silver, and gold layers to ensure robust data quality and transformation. The project guides you through efficient ETL processes, advanced data modeling, and the development of specialized data marts for targeted analytics. Discover how raw data is ingested, cleansed, and transformed into valuable insights, all within a scalable, well-structured SQL environment.

# Project Overview

🗄️ Data Architecture
The data warehouse is structured in multiple layers to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance:

🥉 Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from multiple sources. This layer acts as a staging area, capturing data in its original format.

🥈 Silver Layer: Data cleansing and transformation. Here, data is standardized, deduplicated, and business rules are applied.

🥇 Gold Layer: Analytics-ready data. Aggregated and modeled data is stored here to support reporting and business intelligence needs.

🔄 ETL Process
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is central to this project:

📥 Extract: Data is collected from various operational sources (databases, flat files, APIs).

🛠️ Transform: Data is cleaned, enriched, and transformed using T-SQL scripts and stored procedures. This includes validation, deduplication, and applying business logic.

📤 Load: Transformed data is loaded into the appropriate warehouse layers (bronze, silver, gold) using automated SQL Server jobs and orchestrated workflows.


🏗️ Data Modeling
⭐ Star Schema: The data model follows a star schema, optimizing for analytical queries. Fact tables hold transactional data, while dimension tables provide descriptive context (e.g., date, customer, product).

🔑 Surrogate Keys & Indexing: Surrogate keys are used for dimension tables, and indexes are created for efficient querying.

🕰️ Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD): Strategies are implemented to track historical changes in dimension data.


📊 Analytics & Reporting
📈 Analytics: The gold layer provides denormalized tables and views for common business questions—such as sales trends, customer segmentation, and performance tracking.

🖥️ Reporting: Data is exposed to reporting tools like Power BI or SSRS. Sample SQL queries, views, or stored procedures are included to support dashboard and report creation.

🏆 KPIs & Dashboards: Example metrics and dashboards are provided (see the /reports folder, if available) to showcase the value of the data warehouse.
